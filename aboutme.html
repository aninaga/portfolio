                    <p>Hi my name is Anirudh Nagasamudra and I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. I developed an interest for coding at a young age due to my father working as a software developer. Through that I developed an immediate interest in anything technology, primarily software. I imagined myself in the place my father was is and being in his position. I plan to pursue computers and engineering by taking the elective CSP. One day I hope to change the world as a Computer Scientist.</p>
                    <p> I am personally very hardworking, persevering, and ambitious. I displayed this when I got into the Fallon Engineering Lab club and learned about building a robot that could drive around and follow lines, be controlled remotely, and play game. On top of that we also learned about coding and implementation of python, microcontrollers such as raspberry pi and how the internet is managed. This hands-on experience drove my passion towards computers and engineering further and made me more aware of how the field really is and works.</p>
                    <p>Another experience that influenced me is my 8th grade CAP project. This project really honed my leadership abilities as team leader. Our project was about green card holders getting to vote for the school board. Having to coordinate everything, I learned how to properly delegate people to use them to maximum efficiency. In the end we had a city officials look at our project and request a conversation with us. This leadership experience helped me know how to manage and lead people as well as hold them and myself accountable for failure to deliver.</p>
                    <p>Thank you reading about me and feel free to look over the rest of my website to gain more information about me and my projects.</p>
