                    <p class="text-white">Hello, my name is Anirudh Nagasamudra and I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. I developed an interest for coding at a young age due to my father working as a software developer and my sister pursing a career in Computer Science as well. Through that I developed an immediate interest in anything technology, primarily software. I began my passion by learning coding when I was just in elementary school and designed many Scratch games and project. During my time at middle school, I have been to many coding camps and programs, learning everything from Minecraft Modding to designing my own Android ROM. Right now as a Freshmen, I am pursuing computers and engineering with my current elective Computer Science Principles(CSP) and in the future more advanced courses. One day I hope to change the world as a Computer Scientist.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">I am very hardworking, persevering, and ambitious. I displayed this when I got into the Fallon Engineering Lab and learned about building a robot that could drive freely, follow lines, be controlled remotely, and participate in a competition at the end of the program. On top of that we also learned about coding and implementation of python, building and using microcontrollers such as raspberry pi, and how learned about how the internet is managed. This hands-on experience drove my passion towards engineering further and made me more aware of how the field really works and what it takes to be succesful in computers.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Another experience that influenced me is my 8th grade Civic Action Project. This project really honed my leadership abilities as team leader. Our project was about green card holders and how they should have a say in their children's education by being able to vote for the school board members, since most of their children will be the future of America. Having to coordinate everything, I learned how to properly delegate work for people at maximum efficiency after figuring out what each member of our team was good at and capable of doing. In the end we had city officials look at our project and request a conversation with us. This leadership experience helped me learn how to research and I learned at lot about the dynamics of leadership.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Thank you reading about me and feel free to look over the rest of my website to gain more information about me and my projects. Also if you want to, you can contact me via a google form on my contact me tab. Thank you for your time.</p>
