                        <p class="text-white">In my scratch project for CSP, a partner and I designed and built a simple platformer game in the timeframe of two weeks. The project objective was to design a game or story that has user interaction. The platformer could move all directions and would run at a certain pace on an only black terrain and avoid everything that is red. At the beginning and the end of each level, there was a portal to take you to the next level and drop you off. The project was my first major experience in building a game and I learned how to make my character jump and have the gravitational force to come down, how to move left and right only on a certain platform and how to make my character die if it touches red.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">This project was important because it helped me learn how to implement my code knowledge and learn new elements of coding. I also had to learn how to do research on different types of blocks and making new blocks in order to write my code.</p>

                        <p class="text-white">In my MIT App inventor project for CSP, two partners and I built a simple photobooth application that could take and store up to four photos, and allow you to draw on them and share the photo booth images. This was one of my first main app based projects and I learned a lot about troubleshooting applications as well as problem-solving. The app would originally take the pictures, but due to Samsung's camera UI making the front facing camera in landscape mode, the pictures would come sideways while in portrait mode. The fix for this was painstakingly changing the basic UI of the app to landscape mode, so the pictures would come out normally. Another issue we ran into was the image clearing. After changes were made to the images with the drawing feature, in order for users to edit and draw the way they wanted a clear function was needed. The consistent issue that we ran into was that the clear function typically ended up removing the photo as well, so we had to change the background image to the photo and the layering on top would be the drawings. </p>
