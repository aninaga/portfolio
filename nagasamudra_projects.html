                        <p class="text-white">In my scratch project for CSP, a partner and I designed and built a simple platformer game in the timeframe of two weeks. The project objective was to design a game or story that has user interaction. The platformer we built could move all directions and would run at a certain pace on a terrain and avoid obstacles. At the beginning and the end of each level, there is a portal to take you to the next level. This project was my first major experience in building a game start to finish from scratch and I learned how to make my character jump and have the gravitational force to come down, how to move left and right only on a platform and how to make my character die if it touches the red obstacles.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">This project was important because it helped me learn how to implement my coding knowledge and learn new elements of coding. I also had to learn how to do research on different types of blocks and making new blocks in order to write my code.</p>

                        <p class="text-white">In my MIT App inventor project for CSP, two partners and I built a simple photobooth application that could take and store up to four photos, and allow you to draw on them and share the photo booth images. This was one of my first main app based projects and I learned a lot about troubleshooting applications as well as problem-solving. The app would originally take the pictures, but due to Samsung's camera UI making the front facing camera in landscape mode, the pictures would come sideways while in portrait mode. The fix for this was painstakingly changing the basic UI of the app to landscape mode, so the pictures would come out normally. Another issue we ran into was the image clearing. After changes were made to the images with the drawing feature, in order for users to edit and draw the way they wanted a clear function was needed. The consistent issue that we ran into was that the clear function typically ended up removing the photo as well, so we had to change the background image to the photo and the layering on top would be the drawings. </p>

                        <p class="text-white">My partner and I made a framing and filteration process where we could add a border onto an image, then add a watermark with the company's logo on to the image as well. The creative process was extensive, but in the end we went with something that could add a personal touch to the images that we put into the program. Our sample company used for the project is Coding for Kids and all the images we used is related to coding in schools, club, etc. One major issue we faced through the development of the code was the watermark addition. The watermark was wither coming out far too large so we decided to add a function that proportionally adds the watermark to a specific coordinate on the image and at a size that is scaled relative to the image. In the end, I feel we have created a strong end result that would be useable if the product was brough into the main industry with little to no tweaking required. </p>
